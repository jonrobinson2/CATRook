Setups up a webservice for using CAT techniques to determine question ordering.  Currently supports:

/next_question
params:
  dis - An array of discrimination parameters (comma separated)
  dif - An array of difficulty parameters
  g   - An array of guessing parameters
  ids - Question IDs, these are internal to the service consumer but when specified will cause the service to return a usable question ID
  a   - An array of question answers, should be 0, 1, or NA.  Where 1 is a correct answer
  uaq - An array of unasked questions, should be 0, 1 where 1 signifies that the question has not yet been asked
  th  - (optional) The current value of theta hat.  Optional but makes web service calls faster
  ro  - (optional) An array with the number of response options for this question (used for polytonomous questions)
